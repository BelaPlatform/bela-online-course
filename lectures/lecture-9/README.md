# Lecture 9: Timing

## [Watch Lecture 9 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E55OAZBU0DM)

This lecture explains how to measure time when working with real-time audio signals, based on counting samples. The lecture includes some basic circuits to make an adjustable metronome with LED and a step sequencer with a clock.

## What you'll learn in this lecture

* Counting time with sampled audio
* Creating delays in real time
* Events and intervals

## What you'll make in this lecture

* A metronome and a step sequencer

## Code examples

**metronome**: Code template for creating a metronome that plays an audio sample at regular intervals.

**step-sequencer-metronome**: An update to the example from Lecture 7, with hooks for you to incorporate a metronome to advance the step.

## About this course

This course is co-developed by Bela (Augmented Instruments Ltd) and Queen Mary University of London. The materials are based on a Master's module "Music and Audio Programming", taught by [Dr Andrew McPherson](http://instrumentslab.org) in the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk). The module is offered on degree programmes including:

* [MSc in Sound and Music Computing](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/129308.html), a one-year Master's programme
* [PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Music](http://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk), a 4-year PhD programme with fully-funded studentships for UK and international students

## Recommended parts

Running the examples in this course assumes that you have a [Bela Starter Kit](https://shop.bela.io/products/bela-starter-kit) or [Bela Mini Starter Kit](https://shop.bela.io/products/bela-mini-starter-kit). Note that the analog outputs are only available on the original Bela board, and not on Bela Mini.
