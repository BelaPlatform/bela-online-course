# Lecture 0: Setting up

## [Watch Lecture 0 on YouTube](https://youtu.be/aVLRUyPBBJk)

This introductory lecture gives an overview of the course, and takes you through your first Bela projects.

## What you'll learn in this lecture

* Setting up your Bela kit
* Running your first projects
* Using the Bela IDE

## Code example

**shepard-risset**: implements a [Shepard-Risset glissando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone), a classic auditory illusion of a tone that appears to gradually ascend without ever becoming any higher.

## About this course

This course is co-developed by Bela (Augmented Instruments Ltd) and Queen Mary University of London. The materials are based on a Master's module "Music and Audio Programming", taught by [Dr Andrew McPherson](http://instrumentslab.org) in the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk). The module is offered on degree programmes including:

* [MSc in Sound and Music Computing](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/129308.html), a one-year Master's programme
* [PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Music](http://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk), a 4-year PhD programme with fully-funded studentships for UK and international students

## Recommended parts

Running the examples in this course assumes that you have a [Bela Starter Kit](https://shop.bela.io/products/bela-starter-kit) or [Bela Mini Starter Kit](https://shop.bela.io/products/bela-mini-starter-kit).

Some of the lectures also work with sensors and other electronic hardware. We suggest the following components, which can be acquired from any electronics supplier:

* Solderless breadboard (any size)
* Potentiometers: at least 2, ideally 8. Choose ones that fit a breadboard.
* Pushbuttons (tactile switches): at least 2, ideally 8.
* LEDs: at least 2, ideally 8, various colours.
* Resistors: 8+ 10k resistors for switches; 8+ 220 ohm resistors for LEDs.
* Force-sensing resistor (FSR), any shape.
* Piezo element (contact microphone), any size, with wire leads attached.
* Jumper wires, including pin-to-socket wires.
* A 3.5mm stereo audio cable for connecting Bela to other audio devices.
