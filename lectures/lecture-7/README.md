# Lecture 7: Digital I/O

## [Watch Lecture 7 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t88Hbz2blms)

This lecture explains how to work with digital input and output on Bela. Like Lecture 6, this lecture involves building simple circuits on a breadboard to connect to Bela. In this case, the lecture focuses on gates and triggers in modular synthesis using the digital I/O pins with a pushbutton.

## What you'll learn in this lecture

* Digital inputs and outputs on Bela
* Working with pushbuttons
* Gates and triggers

## What you'll make in this lecture

* A noise generator and a step sequencer

## Code examples

**digital-io**: A complete example showing digital input and output with a white noise generator

**step-sequencert**: An example to be completed during the lecture, using a button press as a trigger to advance a step sequencer changing the frequency of an oscillator.

## About this course

This course is co-developed by Bela (Augmented Instruments Ltd) and Queen Mary University of London. The materials are based on a Master's module "Music and Audio Programming", taught by [Dr Andrew McPherson](http://instrumentslab.org) in the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk). The module is offered on degree programmes including:

* [MSc in Sound and Music Computing](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/129308.html), a one-year Master's programme
* [PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Music](http://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk), a 4-year PhD programme with fully-funded studentships for UK and international students

## Recommended parts

Running the examples in this course assumes that you have a [Bela Starter Kit](https://shop.bela.io/products/bela-starter-kit) or [Bela Mini Starter Kit](https://shop.bela.io/products/bela-mini-starter-kit). Note that the analog outputs are only available on the original Bela board, and not on Bela Mini.
