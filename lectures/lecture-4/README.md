# Lecture 4: Parameter Control

## [Watch Lecture 4 on YouTube](https://youtu.be/LvrouuNiNGU)

This lecture explains explains linear and logarithmic scales and how to control your projects from Bela's browser-based GUI.

## What you'll learn in this lecture

* Using the Bela GUI to control projects from the browser
* Mapping parameters
* Decibel scales for amplitude
* Converting MIDI note number to frequency

## What you'll make in this lecture

* Multiple oscillators with detuning 

## Code examples

**sine-slider**: a complete example using the Bela slider GUI to control the frequency and amplitude of a sine oscillator. During the lecture, this example is converted to use a decibel scale for amplitude.

**wavetable-slider**: an example like `sine-slider` but with a sawtooth wavetable oscillator. During the lecture, several improvements are made to this example including two detuned oscillators and controlling pitch in semitones rather than Hertz.

## About this course

This course is co-developed by Bela (Augmented Instruments Ltd) and Queen Mary University of London. The materials are based on a Master's module "Music and Audio Programming", taught by [Dr Andrew McPherson](http://instrumentslab.org) in the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk). The module is offered on degree programmes including:

* [MSc in Sound and Music Computing](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/129308.html), a one-year Master's programme
* [PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Music](http://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk), a 4-year PhD programme with fully-funded studentships for UK and international students

## Recommended parts

Running the examples in this course assumes that you have a [Bela Starter Kit](https://shop.bela.io/products/bela-starter-kit) or [Bela Mini Starter Kit](https://shop.bela.io/products/bela-mini-starter-kit).

This lecture does not require any other electronic hardware. However, other lectures will make use of sensors and other components. See [Lecture 0](../lecture-0) for a list of recommended parts.
